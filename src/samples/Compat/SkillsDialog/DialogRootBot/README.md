# DialogRootBot Sample

This is a sample showing the migration of a Bot Framework Bot to the Agents SDK.  This is a modified version of the Bot Framework `81.skills-skilldialog\DialogRootBot`, along with `DialogSkillBot`, of a Bot Framework v4 Bot that uses the `Dialogs.SkillsDialog` to call a Skill Bot.  The sample has been modified to use the Agents SDK.

## Prerequisites

- [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) version 8.0
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows)

## Running this sample

**To run the sample connected to Azure Bot Service, the following additional tools are required:**

- Access to an Azure Subscription with access to preform the following tasks:
    - Create and configure Entra ID Application Identities
    - Create and configure an [Azure Bot Service](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-CreateBot) for your Azure Bot.
    - Create and configure an [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/) to deploy your Agent to.
    - A tunneling tool to allow for local development and debugging should you wish to do local development whilst connected to a external client such as Microsoft Teams.

## Getting Started with DialogRootBot Sample

### QuickStart using WebChat

1. [Create an Azure Bot](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-CreateBot)
   - Record the Application ID, the Tenant ID, and the Client Secret for use below

1. Configuring the token connection in the Agent settings
   > The instructions for this sample are for a SingleTenant Azure Bot using ClientSecrets.  The token connection configuration will vary if a different type of Azure Bot was configured.  For more information see [DotNet MSAL Authentication provider](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-DotNetMSALAuth)

   1. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the root of the sample project.

   1. Find the section labeled `Connections`,  it should appear similar to this:

      ```json
      "Connections": {
        "ServiceConnection": {
          "Settings": {
            "AuthType": "ClientSecret", // this is the AuthType for the connection, valid values can be found in Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal.Model.AuthTypes.  The default is ClientSecret.
            "AuthorityEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{TenantId}}",
            "ClientId": "{{ClientId}}", // this is the Client ID used for the connection.
            "ClientSecret": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // this is the Client Secret used for the connection.
            "Scopes": [
              "https://api.botframework.com/.default"
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      ```

      1. Replace all **{{ClientId}}** with the AppId of the Azure Bot.
      1. Replace all **{{TenantId}}** with the Tenant Id where your application is registered.
      1. Set the **ClientSecret** to the Secret that was created for your identity.
      
      > Storing sensitive values in appsettings is not recommend.  Follow [AspNet Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-9.0) for best practices.

1. Update the ChannelHost configuration in `appsettings.json`
   ```json
   "Agent": {
     "ClientId": "{{ClientId}}", // this is the Client ID for Agent1
     "Host": {
       "DefaultEndpoint": "http://localhost:3978/api/agentresponse/", // Default host serviceUrl.  This is the Url to this Agent and AgentResponseController path.
       "Agents": {
         "Echo": {
           "ConnectionSettings": {
             "ClientId": "{{Agent2ClientId}}", // This is the Client ID of Agent2
             "Endpoint": "http://localhost:39783/api/messages", // The endpoint of Agent2
             "TokenProvider": "ServiceConnection"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   },

   ```
   1. Replace **{{Agent2ClientId}}** with the AppId of Agent2.
   1. Replace **{{ClientId}}** with the AppId of Agent1.

   > Storing sensitive values in appsettings is not recommend.  Follow [AspNet Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-9.0) for best practices.
    
1. Run `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`

1. Start the Agent in Visual Studio

1. Select **Test in WebChat** on the Azure Bot
