# Teams Meeting Context Sample C# 

This sample application illustrates how to display the contents of the meeting context object in a Microsoft Teams meeting tab. By using the bot's meeting APIs, it enables users to retrieve and interact with detailed information about meeting participants and the meeting itself, including start times, end times, and joining URLs, thus enhancing the collaborative experience within Teams.

## Included Features
* Bots
* Meeting Chat 
* Meeting Details
* RSC Permissions

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app manifest (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Teams Meeting Context Sample:** [Manifest](/samples/meetings-context-app/csharp/demo-manifest/meetings-context-app.zip)
 
## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  .[NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) SDK.
    ```bash
        # determine dotnet version
        dotnet --version
    ```
-  [dev tunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows)

## Running this sample

1. [Create an Azure Bot](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-CreateBot)
   - Be sure to add the Teams Channel
   - Record the Application ID, the Tenant ID, and the Client Secret for use below

1. Configuring the token connection in the Agent settings
   > The instructions for this sample are for a SingleTenant Azure Bot using ClientSecrets.  The token connection configuration will vary if a different type of Azure Bot was configured.  For more information see [DotNet MSAL Authentication provider](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-DotNetMSALAuth)

   1. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the root of the sample project.

   1. Find the section labeled `Connections`,  it should appear similar to this:

      ```json
      "TokenValidation": {
        "Audiences": [
          "{{ClientId}}" // this is the Client ID used for the Azure Bot
        ],
		"TenantId": "{{TenantId}}"
      },

      "Connections": {
          "BotServiceConnection": {
          "Assembly": "Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal",
          "Type":  "MsalAuth",
          "Settings": {
              "AuthType": "ClientSecret", // this is the AuthType for the connection, valid values can be found in Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal.Model.AuthTypes.  The default is ClientSecret.
              "AuthorityEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{TenantId}}",
              "ClientId": "{{ClientId}}", // this is the Client ID used for the connection.
              "ClientSecret": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // this is the Client Secret used for the connection.
              "Scopes": [
                "https://api.botframework.com/.default"
              ]
          }
      }
      ```

      1. Replace all **{{ClientId}}** with the AppId of the bot identity.
      1. Set the **ClientSecret** to the Secret that was created for your identity.
      1. Replace all **{{TenantId}}** with the Tenant Id where your application is registered.
      1. Set the **Audience** to the AppId of the bot identity.
      
      > Storing sensitive values in appsettings is not recommend.  Follow [AspNet Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-9.0) for best practices.

1. Manually update the manifest.json
   - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the `/appManifest` folder
     - Replace with your AppId (that was created above) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID>>`
     - Replace `<<BOT_DOMAIN>>` with your Agent url.  For example, the tunnel host name.
   - Zip up the contents of the `/appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
1. Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams
   - Select **Developer Portal** in the Teams left sidebar
   - Select **Apps** (top row)
   - Select **Import app**, and select the manifest.zip

1. Run `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:
   > NOTE: Go to your project directory and open the `./Properties/launchSettings.json` file. Check the port number and use that port number in the devtunnel command (instead of 3978).

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`

1. Start the Agent, and select **Preview in Teams** in the upper right corner
 
## Interacting with this Agent in Teams

- Add the app in meeting.
- The details of the meeting context object will be shown on tab based.
![participant context](MeetingContextApp/Images/Setup-Tab-Bot.png)

- You can expand/reduce the JSON for the context object and can also copy a particular object slice.
- You can send one of these two commands: **Meeting Context** or **Participant Context**
- It will send you the output of `TeamsInfo.getMeetingInfo` and `TeamsInfo.getMeetingParticipant`

1. **Particpant Details :** User can see the details of current participant by the name id and other feilds respectively.

2. **Meeting Details :** In this user can track the detials of meeting start time, end time, joining url and other details respectively.
