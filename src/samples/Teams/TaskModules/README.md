# Teams Task Modules (Dialogs)

This Agent has been created using [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/agents). It demonstrates how to use Teams **task modules** (also called dialogs in Teams) — modal windows that bots can open to collect structured user input.

## What This Sample Demonstrates

- **Simple form dialog** — A single-step Adaptive Card with a Name input field
- **Webpage dialog** — A URL-based dialog loading an HTML form (Name + Email) from the bot's own endpoint
- **Multi-step form** — A two-step dialog flow: step 1 collects Name, step 2 collects Email. Returns a `TaskModuleResponse` built with the `Continue` response type to advance steps without closing the dialog.
- **Mixed example** — Placeholder showing how to combine approaches in a workflow
- **Launcher card** — Sending an Adaptive Card from a message handler with `TaskFetchAction` buttons

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) (for Webpage Dialog, so Teams can reach your localhost)
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or Teams account with app install permissions

## Running This Sample

1. [Create an Azure Bot](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-CreateBot)
   - Add the Teams Channel
   - Record the Application ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret

1. Configure `appsettings.json`:

   ```json
   "TokenValidation": {
     "Audiences": ["{{ClientId}}"]
   },
   "Connections": {
     "ServiceConnection": {
       "Settings": {
         "AuthType": "ClientSecret",
         "AuthorityEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{TenantId}}",
         "ClientId": "{{ClientId}}",
         "ClientSecret": "{{ClientSecret}}",
         "Scopes": [
           "https://api.botframework.com/.default"
         ]       
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `{{ClientId}}`, `{{TenantId}}`, and `{{ClientSecret}}` with your Azure Bot values.

1. Manually update the manifest.json
   - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the `/appManifest` folder
     -  Replace with your AppId (that was created above) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID>>`
     - Replace `<<BOT_DOMAIN>>` with your Agent url.  For example, the tunnel host name.
   - Zip up the contents of the `/appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
1. Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams
   - Select **Developer Portal** in the Teams left sidebar
   - Select **Apps** (top row)
   - Select **Import app**, and select the manifest.zip

1. Run `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:
   > NOTE: Go to your project directory and open the `./Properties/launchSettings.json` file. Check the port number and use that port number in the devtunnel command (instead of 3978).

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`

1. Start the Agent, and select **Preview in Teams** in the upper right corner

## How It Works

When the user sends a message, the bot responds with an Adaptive Card showing four buttons. Each button uses a `TaskFetchAction` that triggers a `task/fetch` invoke activity routed by `[TeamsTaskFetchRoute("verb")]` to the appropriate handler.

Form submissions inside the dialogs trigger `task/submit` invoke activities routed by `[TeamsTaskSubmitRoute("verb")]` to their handlers.

The multi-step form uses `TaskModuleResponse.CreateBuilder()` with `TaskModuleResponseTypes.Continue`: the step-1 submit handler returns the step-2 card instead of closing the dialog, keeping it open with fresh content for step 2.

## Enabling JWT token validation
1. By default, the AspNet token validation is disabled in order to support local debugging.
1. Enable by updating appsettings
   ```json
   "TokenValidation": {
     "Enabled": false,
     "Audiences": [
       "{{ClientId}}" // this is the Client ID used for the Azure Bot
     ],
     "TenantId": "{{TenantId}}"
   },
   ```
